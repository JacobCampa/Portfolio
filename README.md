# Portfolio

## Description

This webpage is a repersintation of my work/accomplishments from my current bootcamp experience. The main goal for this webpage will be to display projects I have worked on for future employers to look at and have refrence of my skill set. I have learn html and css up to this point and currently learning javascript. There will be future updates along the way to ensure I create the best portfolio I possibly can.


## Usage
To use this webpage type this url into your browser or click the link below:

https://jacobcampa.github.io/Portfolio/

This webpage is fairly straight forward. Hover over the project images to reveal them (in the future will link to the actual projects) and you can use the nav bar to jump on the page to the corisponding section. Currently i have nothing to show so everything has place holders at the moment.
